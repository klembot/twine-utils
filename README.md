# twine-utils

This lets you work with Twee source, Twine 2 stories, and story formats in a
programmatic way: combining them, adding extra JS or CSS, or otherwise modifying
them in JavaScript.

This also contains two command-line tools:

  -  _entwine_ combines source files and publish to a new story format.
  - _entwee_ combines source files and saves as Twee source code.
